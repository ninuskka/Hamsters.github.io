    <h2>General Health Care Tips</h2>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Diet: Ensure a balanced diet with commercial hamster pellets, fresh vegetables (like carrots, broccoli, and cucumber), and occasional fruits (like apples and berries). Avoid sugary, salty, or acidic foods.</li>
    <br><li>Water: Provide fresh water daily using a water bottle with a sipper tube to prevent contamination.</li>
    <br><li>Habitat: Keep the cage clean with suitable bedding (like aspen shavings or paper-based bedding), regular cleaning, and removal of soiled bedding.</li>
    <br><li>Exercise and Enrichment: Provide a wheel for exercise, tunnels, and toys to stimulate physical and mental activity.</li>
    <br><li>Handling and Socialization: Handle your hamster gently and regularly to build trust. Ensure hands are clean before handling to avoid transferring oils or scents.</li>
    <br><li>Observation: Regularly check your hamster for signs of illness, such as changes in behavior, appetite, or appearance. Early detection is key to successful treatment.</li><br>
    </ul>
    
	<h2>Veterinary Care</h2>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Routine Check-ups: Schedule regular veterinary visits to monitor health and catch potential issues early.</li>
    <br><li>Emergency Care: Seek immediate veterinary attention if you notice signs of severe illness, injury, or distress.</li>
    <br><li>Quarantine New Hamsters: If you bring a new hamster home, quarantine it for a few weeks to ensure it is healthy and to prevent the spread of diseases to other pets.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>By providing proper care, a balanced diet, and a clean living environment, you can help ensure your hamster stays healthy and happy. Regular observation and prompt veterinary care when needed are crucial to addressing health issues effectively.</p>
